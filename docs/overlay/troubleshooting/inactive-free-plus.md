# Inactive Free+

You've joined the [Cubelify Discord server](https://discord.gg/cubelify) and linked with `/link` but the overlay is
still saying that Free+ is not active? You've most likely logged in with a different Discord account that the one you
joined the server with. Here are some steps that should help you solve that.

:::info

You've followed these steps but Free+ is still shown as inactive? Please create a ticket in the Cubelify Discord server.

:::

## Determine Your Discord Username

Open your Discord server profile (you can do that by pressing your name in a message you sent, in `#system`, or in the
member list). Your Discord username should be visible below your display name - see example below.

:::caution

If you don't have the User role you'll need to link with `/link` first.

Check that the Discord username matches your Discord username. If not, press *Not you?* and log in with the correct
account. If it does, press *Authorize*.

## Log In Again to the Overlay

Now all you have to do log in again to the overlay. First, log out of the overlay by pressing your name and then *Log
Out*.

:::info

If you've already completed initial setup you'll need to press the menu button in the top left corner and then your name
in the bottom left corner instead.

Then, log in again by pressing the `Log In` button.

Your Discord username should now be shown and a message should appear saying that Free+ is active.
