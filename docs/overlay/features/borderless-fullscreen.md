# Borderless Fullscreen

The overlay does not support native fullscreen. Only borderless fullscreen is supported. Minecraft does not have such a
feature built-in, but you can use the overlay's borderless fullscreen functionality.

:::note

This feature is only available on Windows.

:::

:::tip

A similar effect can be achieved with [the third-party Borderless Gaming app](/overlay/miscellaneous/fullscreen).

:::

## Set Up

You'll first need to set up a keyboard shortcut. Open *Settings* &rarr; *Keyboard Shortcuts*.

Press the empty *Keyboard Shortcut* field next to *Toggle borderless fullscreen for Minecraft* and press the keyboard
shortcut you'd like to use for this functionality on your keyboard, e.g. `Shift+F11`.

:::warning

Avoid using single-key shortcuts and shortcuts already used by other applications.

:::

:::info

If you don't see *Toggle borderless fullscreen for Minecraft* option make sure you're using the latest version of the
overlay and that you're using a supported Operating System for this feature.

## Usage

Before using the keyboard shortcut make sure that:

1. Minecraft is running
2. Minecraft is in windowed mode
3. The overlay is running

To toggle borderless fullscreen, **focus the Minecraft window** by clicking on it and then press the keyboard shortcut
you've previously set up (e.g. `Shift+F11`). Minecraft should be switched into borderless fullscreen mode.

Press the keyboard shortcut again to disable borderless fullscreen.
