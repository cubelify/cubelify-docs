# Fullscreen

You can use the Cubelify Overlay in borderless fullscreen mode with the help of a free 3rd party application called
Borderless Gaming.

:::info

The Borderless Gaming app is only available on Windows.

:::

## Installation

First of all, you'll need to download the Borderless Gaming installer from
[this page](https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming/releases/latest). Press the download link for a file
labelled as `BorderlessGamingX.X.X_admin_setup.exe` or similarly located in the Assets section.

Wait for the download to finish. After it does, launch the downloaded file in order to install the app. Follow the
on-screen instructions until the installation is completed. Afterwards, launch the app. You should be greeted by the
following screen:

- `Close To Tray`

Next, make sure that Minecraft's built-in fullscreen is disabled by pressing `F11` or disabling it in Video Settings
(if you're using OptiFine, it'll be located under Video Settings > Other).

If you're using a client like Lunar Client or Badlion Client, make sure its built-in borderless fullscreen is
disabled as well.

Now go back to the Borderless Gaming app. Locate your Minecraft window on the `Applications` list. Its name might
vary depending on what launcher/client and Minecraft version you use, however it should always also have `java`
located somewhere at its end.

Now press the right arrow button in the middle to add it to favorites.

It should then be added to the favorites list.

Minecraft should now automatically enter borderless fullscreen mode after every launch. The overlay should appear on
top of it. If this is not the case, please make sure you've followed all the instructions listed below. If you're
still unable to resolve the issue, please contact support via the
[Cubelify Discord server](https://discord.gg/cubelify).

:::caution

If you're using Lunar Client, you may have to reconfigure Borderless Gaming after updating Lunar Client.
