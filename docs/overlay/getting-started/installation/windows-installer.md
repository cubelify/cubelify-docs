You might receive a warning from Microsoft Defender SmartScreen stating that the app is unrecognized. If that
occurs, press `More info`, and then `Run anyway`.

:::info

This warning is shown because the application is not signed, not because its content has been flagged by an antivirus.
It is not shown if you
[install the app using Microsoft Store](/overlay/getting-started/installation/windows-microsoft-store).

The installation of the app will then commence. After it is finished, the app will be launched.
