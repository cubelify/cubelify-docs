# Premium

users.

## Perks

You compare the various plans available [here](https://cubelify.com/premium).

## Obtaining

There are a few ways available that you can utilize to obtain Premium.

### Subscribing

The easiest way to obtain Premium is by subscribing at the cost of $5/month or $50/year. You can do that by visiting
your [account settings](https://cubelify.com/settings). Payments are handled through Stripe.

#### How-To

Open [Cubelify account settings](https://cubelify.com/settings). Log in if you're not logged in already.

After successfully logging in you should be able to see this on your screen:

Press `Subscribe` in order to open the checkout page. You may be asked to log in again.

If the subscription button is disabled and says `Subscribed` it means you already have a subscription. You can
press the `Manage` button to the right of the subscription status to manage it.

:::

The checkout page will be opened. Here you will need to enter your payment details.

You can also choose to switch to yearly billing here or apply a promotion code.

After entering all the required information, press `Subscribe` to confirm starting your subscription. You might be
asked to confirm your payment or enter additional details in some cases.

If everything goes as expected, your subscription should get successfully started.

#### Managing

To manage your subscription, open [Cubelify account settings](https://cubelify.com/settings). Log in if required.
You should be able to see a `Manage` button to the right of the subscription status. Press it in order to launch the
billing portal and manage your subscription.

### Alternative Methods

#### Discord Server Boost

Another way you can obtain Premium is by boosting the [official Cubelify Discord server](https://discord.gg/cubelify)
. Please note that this is only available to the first 15 boosters, meaning that if you boost while there are
already 15 or more boosters you'll have to wait until one (or more) of them resign, sorted by the time
they started boosting in ascending order.

##### How-To

First of all, you'll need to [join the official Cubelify Discord server](https://discord.gg/cubelify).

Before you continue, you can check how many boosters there are at the moment by using the command `/boost-premium`
of the Cubelify Discord bot. This command will also show your position if you're already boosting.

Afterwards if the booster limit hasn't been reached yet, or you'd like to reserve a spot in the queue, boost the
Discord server.

#### Crypto

If you'd like to purchase Premium using cryptocurrency, please create a ticket (category: Billing) in the [Cubelify
Discord server](https://discord.gg/cubelify). Please note that only BTC, ETH, LTC and BCH are accepted and you have to
purchase at least 3 months.

#### Other

There are also some other ways of obtaining Premium, such as winning events, tournaments and giveaways, or
participating in limited time events. We announce these the `#announcements`, `#giveaways` and `#events` channels in
the [official Cubelify Discord server](https://discord.gg/cubelify)
