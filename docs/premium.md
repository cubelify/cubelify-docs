## Obtaining

There are a few ways available that you can utilize to obtain Premium.

### Patreon

You can obtain Premium by becoming a patron at the cost of $5 per month.

#### How-To

Open [Cubelify account settings](https://cubelify.com/settings). Log in if you're not logged in already.

![](/img/docs/premium/log-in.png)

Locate the "Premium" section. The list there should have "Patreon" as its first element. Press the "Link" button on
the right. If you see a "Join" or "Manage" button, skip to the next step.

Press the "Join" button. If you see a "Manage" button, then you're already an active patron and you do not need to
take any further steps.

You'll then have to become a patron on the Patreon website in order to obtain Premium.

:::info

Please keep in mind that you'll be charged on the day you subscribe and then on the 1st day of every month that
follows, so for example if you subscribe on May 20th, you'll be charged on May 20th and then on June 1st, July 1st,
August 1st etc.

### Discord Server Boost

Another way you can obtain Premium is by boosting the [official Cubelify Discord server](https://discord.gg/cubelify)
. Please note that this is only available to the first 15 boosters, meaning that if you boost while there are
already 15 or more boosters you'll have to wait until one (or more) of them resign, sorted by the time
they started boosting in ascending order.

#### How-To

First of all, you'll need to [join the official Cubelify Discord server](https://discord.gg/cubelify).

Before you continue, you can check how many boosters there are at the moment by using the command `/boost-premium`
of the Cubelify Discord bot. This command will also show your position if you're already boosting.

Afterwards if the booster limit hasn't been reached yet, or you'd like to reserve a spot in the queue, boost the
Discord server.

### Other

There are also some other ways of obtaining Premium, such as winning events, tournaments and giveaways, or
participating in limited time events. We announce these the `#announcements`, `#giveaways` and `#events` channels in
the [official Cubelify Discord server](https://discord.gg/cubelify)
